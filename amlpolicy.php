                <strong>MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING</strong>
              </h1>
              <p>Money laundering entails the concealment of the origins of unlawfully obtained funds to lend them an appearance of legitimacy. It encompasses the funneling of proceeds from criminal endeavors such as drug trafficking, fraud, corruption, or other illicit activities through a convoluted series of financial transactions. The primary aim of money laundering is to veil the illicit source of the funds, rendering it arduous for authorities to trace back to its criminal roots. This process typically unfolds across three stages: placement (where illicit funds infiltrate the financial system), layering (where multiple transactions are executed to obscure the money's trail), and integration (where the 'cleaned' money is reintegrated into the economy).</p>
              <p>Conversely, terrorist financing entails the provision of financial assistance or resources to enable terrorist activities, encompassing the planning, preparation, and execution of terrorist acts. The funds may originate from diverse channels, including legitimate sources, donations, criminal enterprises, or state backing. Terrorist entities leverage these funds to recruit members, train operatives, procure weaponry, and execute their nefarious agendas. Disrupting the financial sustenance of terrorist organizations is imperative in impeding their operations and safeguarding global security.</p>
              <p>Both money laundering and terrorist financing represent substantial threats to both the global financial system and national security. Regulatory bodies, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies collaborate globally to enforce rigorous anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protocols aimed at identifying and thwarting these illicit practices. The objective is to fortify the integrity of the financial system, uphold ethical norms, and shield societies from the detrimental impacts of money laundering and terrorist activities.</p>

              <p> Throughout the intricate process of money laundering, criminals exploit vulnerabilities within financial systems, regulatory gaps, and the intricate nature of global transactions to obfuscate the origins of illicit funds. To effectively counteract this illicit activity, authorities, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies deploy advanced anti-money laundering (AML) measures, robust transaction monitoring systems, and foster international collaboration to identify and thwart such nefarious schemes. By disrupting the money laundering chain, law enforcement agencies aim to sever the financial lifelines of criminal enterprises, safeguarding the integrity of the global financial ecosystem.</p>

              <p>In risk management, impact levels are commonly classified into five categories, spanning from low to high. These classifications aid in gauging the potential repercussions or severity of a risk event. Below are the five impact levels:</p>
              <p>Insignificant (Low Impact): Risks falling into this category have minimal consequences for the organization or project. They may lead to minor disruptions or negligible financial losses, which can be easily mitigated without substantial impact on overarching operations or objectives.</p>
              <p>Minor (Low to Medium Impact): Risks categorized as minor have the potential to result in moderate disruptions or financial losses, which can be addressed with relatively straightforward risk mitigation measures. Though they necessitate attention, they are not anticipated to inflict severe or enduring damage.</p>
              <p>Moderate (Medium Impact): Risks falling into the moderate category pose more substantial consequences that could impact the organization's operations, finances, or reputation. Addressing these risks effectively may require a well-considered response and mitigation plan.</p>
              <p>Major (Medium to High Impact): Risks classified as major carry significant consequences that can profoundly disrupt operations, lead to substantial financial losses, or inflict considerable damage on the organization's reputation. Immediate attention and robust risk mitigation efforts are imperative to address these risks effectively.</p>
              <p>Severe (High Impact): Risks classified as severe entail catastrophic consequences capable of severely damaging or even jeopardizing the organization's existence. They epitomize the most critical threats and necessitate immediate and comprehensive risk management strategies to prevent or mitigate their occurrence.</p>
              <p>By leveraging these five impact levels, organizations can adeptly assess and prioritize risks in tandem with their likelihood (probability) of occurrence. This fosters informed decision-making, optimal resource allocation, and the formulation of tailored risk management strategies to safeguard the organization's interests and bolster resilience amidst uncertainties.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>In our AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Policy, comprehending and addressing the concept of "customer" is paramount. A customer, within the scope of our policy, encompasses individuals, organizations, or entities engaging in transactions with our company, be it purchasing goods, availing services, or conducting financial activities. As a financial institution dedicated to maintaining the utmost integrity and compliance standards, we view our customers as vital stakeholders, acknowledging the responsibility to ensure that our interactions with them adhere to all pertinent AML and CTF (Counter-Terrorist Financing) regulations.</p>
              <h2>
                <a id="_Toc164787838"></a>5.2 Type of Customer in General
              </h2>
              <p>In terms of customer diversity and risk assessment, we recognize the varied nature of customers, categorizing them into different groups based on their characteristics and associated risks. These customer types may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Individual Customers: These are natural persons engaging in personal transactions with our company, such as opening accounts, making purchases, or conducting financial transactions for personal purposes.</li>
                <li>Corporate Customers: Legal entities, including companies, businesses, partnerships, and other organizations, transacting with our company for commercial or business-related activities fall under this category.</li>
                <li>Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs): Individuals holding prominent public positions or positions of influence are classified as PEPs. Given their susceptibility to corruption and financial crime, we treat them as a high-risk category and implement enhanced due diligence measures.</li>
                <li>High-Risk Customers: Besides PEPs, certain customers or customer groups may be designated as high-risk due to factors like their geographic location, business activities, or sources of funds. These customers necessitate additional scrutiny and more robust risk management measures.</li>
                <li>Low-Risk Customers: Customers displaying minimal risk concerning money laundering or terrorist financing activities are categorized as low-risk. Nonetheless, we uphold standard customer due diligence procedures to ensure compliance.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>
                <a id="_Toc164787839"></a>5.3 Classification of Customer in PrimeWealth FX LTD
              </h2>
              <p>At PrimeWealth FX LTD, we prioritize adherence to domestic regulations and the maintenance of a robust risk management framework to effectively combat money laundering. To achieve this, we've implemented Customer Identification and Know Your Customer policies.</p>
              <p>Within our framework, we classify our customers into two distinct groups: "Wholesale" Customers and "Retail" Customers. This categorization allows us to streamline our risk management processes while ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
              <p>For "Retail" Customers, we've established fewer identification requirements compared to "Wholesale" Customers. This distinction aims to facilitate a smooth onboarding process for our valued individual customers. Consequently, "Retail" Customers are not subject to the full extent of "Know Your Customer" policies.</p>
              <p>Through this categorization, PrimeWealth FX LTD optimizes its money laundering risk management efforts while efficiently managing business operations. This approach enables effective resource allocation, with heightened attention on higher-risk customer segments.</p>
              <p>To qualify as a "Retail" customer, total transactions, including custody transfers, must not exceed the USD 30,000 threshold (or its equivalent in other currencies) within a calendar year. This threshold encompasses individual customers or smaller entities engaged in lower-value transactions, aiding in risk categorization.</p>
              <p>Distinguishing between "Wholesale" and "Retail" customers upholds the highest standards of compliance, ethics, and security. This risk-based approach tailors AML policies to meet the unique needs of different customer segments, fostering a safer and more efficient financial environment for all stakeholders.</p>

                <a id="_Toc164787840"></a>5.4 Customer Approval Policy
              </h2>
              <p>Our Customer Approval Policy delineates the criteria and procedures for onboarding new customers and forging business relationships. The policy is underpinned by the following key principles:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Risk-Based Approach: We employ a risk-based approach to customer evaluation and acceptance, tailoring the level of due diligence to the perceived risk profile of each customer. Greater scrutiny is applied to higher-risk customers.</li>
                <li>Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Integral to our acceptance process is comprehensive customer due diligence. This encompasses identity verification, understanding the nature of the customer's business, and assessing the sources of their funds.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): For high-risk customers, including politically exposed persons (PEPs) and select business entities, we implement enhanced due diligence measures to delve deeper into their backgrounds and evaluate potential risks associated with the relationship.</li>
                <li>Ongoing Monitoring: Our policy mandates ongoing monitoring of customer relationships to promptly identify any changes in customer behavior or risk profiles throughout the course of the relationship.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Through the implementation of a robust Customer Approval Policy and adherence to defined customer categories, our company endeavors to cultivate a secure and compliant environment while nurturing positive and trusted relationships with our esteemed clientele. This customer-centric approach underscores our dedication to combating money laundering and terrorist financing activities, thereby upholding the integrity of the financial system and supporting collaborative endeavors to fortify the global business landscape.</p>
              <p>Our customer approval policy includes the following key principles:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Proper Identification: Customers must undergo a comprehensive identification process for acceptance. Failure to provide adequate identification will result in rejection. This pivotal step is integral to thwarting illicit activities and validating the authenticity of customer relationships.</li>
                <li>Blacklisted Unwanted Customers: Our company strictly prohibits the establishment of business relationships with individuals or entities listed as "Unwanted Customers." This measure serves to shield our organization from any connection with individuals or entities involved in suspicious or criminal activities</li>
                <li>OFAC SDN and UN Consolidated List: Customers identified on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) watch list and/or the United Nations "Consolidated List" are strictly prohibited from being accepted. This measure is implemented to mitigate risks associated with entities subject to international sanctions.</li>
                <li>No Anonymous or Fictitious Names: The company categorically refrains from establishing business relationships with individuals who provide anonymous or fictitious names. Complete transparency and proper identification are mandatory prerequisites for customer acceptance, ensuring transaction legitimacy and mitigating the risk of money laundering</li>
                <li>Legitimacy of Business and Funds: Customers whose business activities impede the verification of their legitimacy or whose funds' origins are inconsistent with their financial status will be declined. Upholding the credibility of customer businesses and funds underscores our dedication to risk management and compliance.</li>
                <li>Submission of Relevant Documentation: Customers are obligated to provide the requisite documentation in a timely manner and in the correct format. Non-compliance with this requirement will result in rejection. Thorough documentation is essential for validating the authenticity of customer relationships</li>
                <li>Suspected Criminal Activities: Customers identified, based on credible information, as suspects in criminal activities, particularly those associated with drug trafficking, terrorism, and organized crime, will be denied acceptance. This measure reaffirms our dedication to fostering a secure and compliant financial environment.</li>
              </ul>

                <strong>CUSTOMER RISK CLASSIFICATION POLICY</strong>
              </h1>
              <p>The 'Customer Risk Classification Policy' represents our organization's systematic approach to evaluating and categorizing customers according to their risk levels concerning money laundering and terrorist financing. This policy empowers us to efficiently oversee and diminish potential risks associated with our customer portfolio. Below, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of its essential elements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Risk Factors Assessment: Our policy encompasses a thorough evaluation of diverse risk factors linked to customers. These factors encompass geographic risk, business activity, source of funds, transaction patterns, customer profile, and any other pertinent indicators of potential risk.</li>
                <li>PEPs Identification: We accord special attention to Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), individuals occupying or having held prominent public positions or positions of influence. PEPs undergo enhanced due diligence measures owing to their elevated vulnerability to corruption and financial crime.</li>
                <li>Risk Categorization: Customers undergo categorization into different risk levels based on the assessment of risk factors. Typically, this categorization entails three levels:</li>
                <li>Low Risk: This category encompasses customers with minimal risk factors and straightforward profiles.</li>
                <li>Medium Risk: Customers falling into this category possess moderate risk factors that may necessitate additional monitoring.</li>
                <li>High Risk: Customers classified as high risk exhibit significant risk factors, such as PEPs or customers originating from high-risk jurisdictions.</li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>

                <li>Enhanced Due Diligence: Higher-risk customers, including those categorized as "Medium Risk" and "High Risk," undergo enhanced due diligence procedures.

                <a id="_Toc164787842"></a>6.1 Due Diligence
              </h2>
              <p>The documentation required from each customer is contingent upon the risk category assigned at the time of account opening.</p>
              <p>Customers deemed low-risk by PrimeWealth FX LTD will be asked to complete a registration form, providing their personal and contact details. In the event of any changes, such as a change in address or telephone number, the customer must promptly inform the company and replace the old registration form with a new one containing the updated information. Additionally, a copy of the customer’s identification must be enclosed. The company is responsible for cross-referencing against available PEP lists to ensure the new customer does not fall into this category.</p>
              <p>Customers categorized as medium-risk are required to provide the same information as low-risk customers, along with additional supporting documentation such as a utility bill as proof of address. They are also mandated to complete a "Know Your Customer" form, detailing the source of funds, estimated annual income, estimated net assets or equity, and estimated total annual investment.</p>
              <p>High-risk customers undergo enhanced due diligence procedures. In addition to the general procedure, a comprehensive report detailing the circumstances must be filed (refer to annexes), outlining all variables considered in creating such a profile. This report must be substantiated by relevant documentation and any sources of information elucidating the customer’s assets, financial position, and/or the source of funds.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The business relationship must be approved by the Compliance Officer</li>
                <li>Additional information must be collected for certain Customer, Products or Services categories.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Customers classified under the PEPs category are mandated to adhere to these requirements consistently, as they are deemed high-risk irrespective of the total amounts transacted.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>It's crucial to highlight that all the aforementioned identity documents must be picture IDs, meaning they must feature a clear photograph of the customer.

                <a id="_Toc164787846"></a>7.1 Suspicious Transactions
              </h2>
              <p>A suspicious transaction refers to a financial activity or transaction that arouses concerns due to its peculiar nature or characteristics. It deviates from the customer's typical behavior or the expected norms for legitimate business transactions. These transactions are identified for additional scrutiny and investigation to ascertain whether they may be associated with illegal or illicit activities.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unusual Nature: Suspicious transactions frequently display uncommon characteristics that significantly diverge from typical patterns observed for a specific customer or industry. These anomalies may encompass unusually large or frequent transactions, erratic transaction timing, or unexpected fluctuations in transaction volumes.</li>
                <li>Inconsistent with Customer Profile: Transactions that do not correspond with the customer's established behavior, risk profile, or known business activities trigger suspicion. For example, a customer recognized for making small, sporadic purchases suddenly initiating high-value international transfers would be deemed inconsistent with their profile.</li>
                <li>Lack of Business or Legal Purpose: Suspicious transactions often lack a clear and legitimate business rationale or legal justification. These may involve transactions where no discernible goods or services are exchanged, or transactions with parties unrelated to the customer's stated business activities.</li>
                <li>Possible Involvement in Illegal Activities: The occurrence of a suspicious transaction may suggest potential involvement in illegal activities, such as money laundering, wherein illicit funds are laundered to appear legitimate. It could also indicate terrorism financing, where funds are funneled to support terrorist activities.</li>
                <li>Fraud and Other Financial Crimes: Suspicious transactions may signal fraudulent activities, such as payment scams, identity theft, or embezzlement. Additionally, they could be associated with other financial crimes, such as tax evasion or corruption.</li>
                <li>Concealment and Manipulation: In certain instances, suspicious transactions may be crafted to circumvent detection thresholds or manipulate reporting requirements. These efforts aim to obscure the true nature of the transaction and may indicate illicit behavior.</li>
                <li>Transactions from High-Risk Jurisdictions: Transactions involving parties or entities from high-risk jurisdictions, characterized by insufficient anti-money laundering controls, may trigger suspicions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It's essential to emphasize that labeling a transaction as suspicious doesn't automatically imply the occurrence of illegal activities. Rather, it signals the necessity for additional investigation and scrutiny to determine whether any unlawful activities are indeed involved.</p>

These systems leverage predefined rules and algorithms to flag potential indicators, such as significant cash transactions, structuring, or sudden alterations in transaction patterns.</li>
                <li>Threshold Reporting: Establish transaction thresholds tailored to different customer segments or transaction types. Transactions exceeding these thresholds prompt alerts for further investigation and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.</li>
                <li>Automated Alerts and Flagging: Configure the system to automatically generate alerts for transactions meeting specific predefined criteria indicative of suspicious activities. This ensures prompt attention and follow-up by the compliance team.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Implement EDD measures for high-risk customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and customers from high-risk jurisdictions.

This officer should ensure compliance with AML policies, monitor alerts from transaction monitoring systems, and facilitate reporting when necessary.</li>
                <li>Training and Awareness: Conduct regular training programs to educate employees on identifying and reporting suspicious transactions effectively. These awareness sessions aid in fostering a culture of compliance and vigilance throughout the organization.</li>
                <li>Internal Investigation Procedures: Develop robust internal investigation procedures to promptly evaluate suspicious transactions. Investigations should be conducted discreetly, with meticulous records maintained.</li>
                <li>Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Perform comprehensive CDD on all customers during the onboarding process. Ensure regular updates to customer information and validate the accuracy of data to facilitate the detection of anomalies.</li>

                <li>Rapid Movement of Funds: Abrupt and recurrent transfer of funds across numerous accounts or jurisdictions without evident business rationale.</li>
                <li>High-Risk Jurisdictions: Transactions involving parties or entities from jurisdictions characterized by inadequate AML controls or a reputation for financial crime.</li>
                <li>Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs): Engaging in business relationships with individuals occupying prominent public positions or positions of influence, as they pose higher risk due to potential corruption vulnerabilities.</li>

              </h2>
              <p>A Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) holds significant importance within the realm of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) endeavors. Serving as a pivotal document, it aids in identifying and reporting potentially illicit financial activities to the pertinent regulatory authorities. The primary objective of an STR is to notify authorities of suspicious transactions, thereby empowering them to initiate further investigations and implement appropriate measures to combat financial crime. Below are the key components of a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR):</p>
              <p>Purpose:</p>
              <p>The primary objective of an STR is to report any financial transaction or activity that arouses suspicion of being associated with money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, or other illicit activities. It serves as a mechanism to identify and thwart financial crimes, safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.</p>
              <p>Detection and Identification:</p>
              <p>An STR is generated when an individual or entity within a financial institution detects a transaction or activity displaying red flags or indicators of potential suspicious behavior. These red flags may encompass large and unexplained cash transactions, frequent structuring, transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions, or other aberrant patterns.</p>
              <p>Content and Information:</p>
              <p>The report usually comprises comprehensive details regarding the suspicious transaction or activity, including the customer's name, account number, transaction date, and amount. It also incorporates a narrative elucidating the nature of the suspicious activity and the rationale behind deeming it as such.</p>
              <p>Supporting Documentation:</p>
              <p>Alongside the narrative description, the STR may encompass supporting documentation like transaction records, customer identification documents, correspondences, and any other pertinent information validating the suspicious nature of the activity.</p>
              <p>Filing and Submission:</p>
              <p>Following the identification of the suspicious transaction and the preparation of the STR, it is promptly lodged with the pertinent regulatory authority. The procedural requirements for submitting an STR may differ based on the jurisdiction and the particular obligations of the financial institution.</p>
              <p>Confidentiality:</p>
              <p>The details contained within an STR are handled with the utmost confidentiality. They are safeguarded under pertinent data protection and privacy regulations to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information pertaining to the financial institution, the customer, or the investigation to unauthorized individuals.</p>
              <p>Impact and Follow-up:</p>
              <p>Upon receipt of an STR, regulatory authorities commence investigations to evaluate the legitimacy of the reported suspicious activity. Depending on the findings, they may undertake enforcement measures such as asset freezing, legal proceedings initiation, or imposition of penalties if illegal activities are substantiated.</p>
              <p>Compliance Obligation:</p>
              <p>Financial institutions bear a legal and ethical responsibility to report suspicious transactions and collaborate with authorities in combatting financial crime. Neglecting to report suspicious activities can result in severe repercussions, including regulatory penalties and damage to reputation.</p>
